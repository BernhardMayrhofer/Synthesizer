# Multidimensional Data Analysis

Data visualization is basically restricted to two dimenstions. It is possible to add a third dimenstion, but then charts get increasingly complex.

Therefore, most analysis try to reduce dimensions in such a way, that the two most important dimenstions are shown in a scatterplot.

Is there another way to develop an interface between the data analyst and a complex and huge dataset?

This project explores a different approach in data visualization: Data Audiolizaion

# Data Audiolization

Sound, like video, hat a time component. Sound can be produced using Synthesizers.

A Synthesizer consists of a sound source (Oscilator) and modules that transform the basic sound. The modules change the pitch, volume, frequency etc.

Using these technologies, this project aims to translate data into sounds, an analyst can use to make sense of big data sets.
